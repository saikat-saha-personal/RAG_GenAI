We also have construction commitments, operating and finance leases, and purchase commitments. The operating lease ROU asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives.

Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.

            "\n",
            "An operating lease is a lease that is not a capital lease, meaning that it does not meet the criteria for a finance lease.

            "A lease is a contract that conveys the right to use an asset for a specified period of time in exchange for consideration. A non-lease component, on the other hand, is a component of a lease contract that is not a lease, such as a service or a product. For example, a lease agreement may include a provision for the lessee to purchase the asset at the end of the lease term, which would be a non-lease component.\n",

            "#### 4. How do you account for a lease with a non-lease component?\n",
            "\n",
            "When accounting for a lease with a non-lease component, you need to separate the lease component from the non-lease component. The lease component is accounted for as a lease, while the non-lease component is accounted for as a separate item on the income statement.\n",

The cumulative total return of each was tracked, showing that Microsoft Corporation had the highest return, with a value of $365.24, followed by the NASDAQ Computer Index with a value of $242.82, and the S&P 500 Index with a value of $178.66. This indicates that Microsoft Corporation performed better than the other two options over the 5-year period. However, it's essential to note that past performance is not a guarantee of future results, and investors should consider other factors before making an investment decision.\n",
